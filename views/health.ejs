                   <p>Maternal health: Many women are now benefitting from massive improvements in care during pregnancy
                    and childbirth introduced in the last century. But those benefits do not extend everywhere and in 2013,
                    almost 300 000 women died from complications in pregnancy and childbirth. Most of these deaths could
                    have been prevented, had access to family planning and to some quite basic services been in place.</p>

                   <p>Getting older: Having often worked in the home, older women may have fewer pensions and benefits, less
                    access to health care and social services than their male counterparts. Combine the greater risk of poverty
                    with other conditions of old age, like dementia, and older women also have a higher risk of abuse and
                    generally, poor health.</p>

                   <p>Mental health: Evidence suggests that women are more prone than men to experience anxiety,
                    depression, and somatic complaints – physical symptoms that cannot be explained medically. Depression
                    is the most common mental health problem for women and suicide a leading cause of death for women
                    under 60. Helping sensitise women to mental health issues, and giving them the confidence to seek
                    assistance, is vital.</p>

                   <p> Cancer: Two of the most common cancers affecting women are breast and cervical cancers. Detecting
                    both these cancers early is key to keeping women alive and healthy. The latest global figures show that
                    around half a million women die from cervical cancer and half a million from breast cancer each year. The
                    vast majority of these deaths occur in low and middle income countries where screening, prevention and
                    treatment are almost non-existent, and where vaccination against human papilloma virus needs to take
                    hold.</p>
