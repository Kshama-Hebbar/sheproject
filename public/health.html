                   Thirty cross-trained, female subjects (19–69 years) completed an endurance exercise session (ES), a resistance exercise session (RS), and a control session (CS) in a randomized, balanced design. The ES consisted of 40 minutes of cycling at 75% maximum heart rate, and the RS consisted of 3 sets of 10 repetitions of eight exercises. During the CS, subjects performed no exercise. Before and after exercise, and after 30 minutes of recovery, blood samples were analyzed for plasma lactate and serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and cortisol. Samples were taken during the CS at the same intervals as during the exercise sessions. There were no age-related differences in intensity measures during exercise. Absolute change from baseline in testosterone (p < .001), estradi Results indicate that an acute bout of exercise can increase concentrations of anabolic hormones in females across a wide age range.</p>
